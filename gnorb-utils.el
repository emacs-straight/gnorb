The goal here is reuse frames and windows as much as possible, so

an issue when opening a link to a message whose *Summary* buffer
is already visible: somehow, after following the link, point ends
up on the message _after_ the one we want, and things go haywire.

So we try to be a little clever. The logical progression here is
this:

1. If the link's target group is already open in a *Summary*
buffer, just switch to that buffer (if it's visible in any frame
then raise it and switch focus, otherwise pull it into the
current window) and go to the message with
`gnus-summary-goto-article'.

2. If the Gnus *Group* buffer is visible in any window or frame,
raise that frame/window and give it focus before following the
link.

3. Otherwise just follow the link as usual, in the current
window."

Selection can happen in a few different ways, depending on the
nature of COLLECTION.  Its elements can be:

1. A plain string.  Simply default to `completing-read'.

2. (string object).  The function uses `completing-read' on the
   strings, returning the selected object.

3. (number object).  As above, but the user enters a number.

4. (character string object).  As #3, but \"string\" is displayed
   as a string label for object.

5. (number string object).  As above, with numbers.

COLLECTION can be passed in ready-made.  Alternately, KEY-FUNC
can be provided.  The collection will be constructed by mapping
this function over the list of objects, and then appending each
object to the corresponding result.  In other words, KEY-FUNC
should return one of the types above, minus the final \"object\"
element.
