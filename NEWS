* Version 1.2 [2017-03-21 Tue]
** Add `gnorb-install-defaults'
New command for installing sane default bindings.
* Version 1.1.3 [2017-03-12 Sun]
** Provide a better interface for trigger action selection
New function `gnorb-select-from-list' providing a nicer interface for
choosing items from a list.
** Change to format of gnorb-org-trigger-actions
Due to previous item, this custom option has changed format, see
docstring for details.
** Compatibility with newest BBDB
Updates to match newest version of BBDB in package repos (mostly with
regard to displaying multi-line field values, BBDB is now
lexically bound).
** Many compiler fixes, and lexical binding
Move to lexical binding.
* Version 1.1.0 [2015-04-23 Thu]
** New trigger actions
Two new trigger actions allow you to capture a new sibling or child
heading relative to the heading you're triggering.
** Persistent Gnorb groups
Give a prefix argument to `gnorb-org-view' to create a named,
persistent group containing tracked headings.
** Gnorb registry usage reports
Call `gnorb-report-tracking-usage' to see how much of the Gnus
registry Gnorb is occupying, and run cleaning routines.
* Version 1.0.1 [2014-10-22 Wed]
** Deleting associations
It's now possible to delete associations between messages and
headings; the user is also prompted to do this at a few points.
** Link following
Following links to messages is a little more clever, and will re-use
existing windows/frames when possible.
** Cleanups/Bugfixes
Proper autoloads, addressing compiler warnings, better chain of
requires, bugfixes.
* Version 1 [2014-10-07 Tue]
** First Elpa Version
** Email Tracking
The mechanism for email tracking has changed since Gnorb was made
available on Elpa. See the manual for set-up instructions.
** Directory Structure
The directory structure has changed since Gnorb was made available on
Elpa. There is no longer a lisp/ directory -- all *.el files are now
at the top level.
